This project is at its early step. More content will be updated soon.  


Use `llm.py` to generate the integrated prompt and obtain the output from GPT-4o for GPT-4.  
Use `llm_eval` to evaluate the performance of models across top-1 accuracy, top-3 accuracy, and top-5 accuracy.  

`my_utils.py` includes all the custom functions used in this project.  
`revised_role_prompt.txt` and `role_prompt.txt` include the prompt template which is used to generate the integrated prompt.
